    'I have just graduated from Bauman Moscow state technical university in the field of computer science. I decided to go with web development, since I understand that it is impossible to succeed in almost any business without some online presence. Hence, I know the opportunities are there and will stay there. But I am not one who would opt for freelancing, since I do not enjoy that part of the job looking for clients, doing marketing, keeping books. I simply enjoy working on the code, developing beautiful websites, and that is why I am here with you. To my greatest hobbies belongs to playing basketball, reading books, dance, violin, fitness, and cooking.',
